4. view the conFusion matrix and see the classification results.


recall = TP / (TP + FN)
precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Recall literally is how many of the true positives were recalled (found), 
i.e. how many of the correct hits were also found.

Precision (your formula is incorrect) is how many of the returned hits were true positive 
i.e. how many of the found were correct hits.

5. Calculation Details
r1 15475 / 15475 + 3272
p1 15475 / 15475 + 2317

r2 3172 /15475 + 3172
p2 3172 / 3172 + 1829

1 33/103
2 30 / 33 + 34 + 30
3 34 / 34 + 65 = 34 / 99
